# Quantum mechanics course notes

## Intro
This repository contains my course notes for the following quantum mechanics course offered by EDX:

[Quantum Mechanics for Scientists and Engineers 1](https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-mechanics-for-scientists-and-engineers-1)


## Contents
This section contains description of the course notes files and folders:


1. *Memo: Where Does Schrodinger Equation Come From?* (filename *schroedinger_equation_motivation.pdf*) - in this text I attempt to explain
how you should approach the Schrodinger equation and how to bette motivate it. This text is based on an excellent lecture by YouTube channel *Physics Explained* -
view it [here](https://youtu.be/2WPA1L9uJqo).


2. *lecture_notes* - this folder contains notes based on
[the course handbook](http://www.alfredo.eng.br/downloads/Miller%20-%20Quantum%20Mechanics%20for%20Scientists%20and%20Engineers%20(Cambridge,%202008).pdf) and the [lectures by David Miller](https://youtu.be/R1qq7ONvPUs).
  - 2.1. Weeks 1 & 2 - WiP
  - 2.2. Week 3 - WiP


3. *technical_notes* - this folder contains various technical notes that pertain
to the topic. These are mostly derivations of useful mathematical relationships
that are later used in the main course notes.
 - 3.1. Coordinates systems - WiP
 - 3.2. Special functions - WiP




## Disclaimers
Notes in this repo are prepared primarily for my own use. Hence, I do not intend to be absolutely clear about every single step in the reasonings presented in these notes. Feel free to use them at your own risk.
